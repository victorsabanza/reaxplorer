This is a simple tool to show how we can share our ML models using streamlit. Find the corresponding notebook [here](). 

With this app you can draw a molecule and predict its reaction products with random molecules from the [Mcule](https://mcule.com/database/) database. We use the [Molecular Transformer](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00576) model to do the reaction prediction. You can then score the predicted products and visualize the corresponding reactions!
